
1) Experiences :

    Sir, i had a chance of gaining experience from one internship at IISC Bangalore
    in the field of computer vision.  our task was to avoid obstacles in front of our drone
    with as minimu computation as possible.
    Its a research based internship and we had to develop our own model for this task.
    A bunch of algorithms for this task are already implemented in real world like tesla is  
    using it to avoid obstacles in front of their self driving cars. But our problem was , we cannot
    fit those heavy sensors in our drone.
    SO we started our research on computer vision particullarly Stereo vision.
    At first, we came up with YOLOV3 model based approach which is fastest object classification algorithm at
    that time. BUt the problem with YOLOV# based model is that it cannot classify all objects so it was ignoring 
    those objects which are not in its class library. 

    SO, we did more research and came to know about ORB  which is Oriented fast and rotated brief algorithm.
    

    ORB  is a feature matching algorithm . It creates descriptors on left frame and matches it with right frame.
   And we can get the disparity of each pixel and with the help of disparity we can calculate the distance of the object 
   from camera . with this distance, we can classify it as obstacle .


SKills : 
  Sir , i am good in c, c++ ,DSA , python. 
  I also do competitive programming on various coding websites.

Projects :

  Obstacle avoidance : explained above.
  BlackJack game : It was just a lab project we had to implement source code of black jack game
