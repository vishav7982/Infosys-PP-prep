 ************************** Questions extracted from INTERVIEW EXPERIENCES of POWER PROGRAMMERS ***********************************



1) what are data structeres and why do we use them ?

  A data structure is a specialized format for organizing and storing data.
  General data structure types include the array, the file, the record, the 
  table, the tree, and so on. Any data structure is designed to organize data
  to suit a specific purpose so that it can be accessed and worked with in 
  appropriate ways.
  Data structures are important for the following reasons:
  1. Data structures are used in almost every program or software system. 
  2. Specific data structures are essential ingredients of many efficient 
     algorithms, and make possible the management of huge amounts of data,
     such as large integrated collection of databases.
  3. Some programming languages emphasize data structures, rather than 
      algorithms, as the key organizing factor in software design.

2)  Explain some of the sorting algorithms you know  and write an algorithm for merge sort?
    i) Bubble sort.
    ii) Merge Sort.
    iii) Insertion Sort.
    iv) Quick Sort.

    ///PsuedoCode or algorithm
    MergeSort(arr[], l,  r)
    If r > l
        1. Find the middle point to divide the array into two halves:  
              middle m = (l+r)/2
        2. Call mergeSort for first half:   
              Call mergeSort(arr, l, m)
        3. Call mergeSort for second half:
              Call mergeSort(arr, m+1, r)
        4. Merge the two halves sorted in step 2 and 3:
               Call merge(arr, l, m, r)



3)  What is Stack ? Use of Stack in real world ?
    Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the
    operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or 
    FILO(First In Last Out).
    Real-world Applications:
    1) To reverse a word. 
    2) An "undo" mechanism in text editors
    3) Back/Forward stacks on browsers
    4) Support for recursion.
    5) Used in DFS.

4)  What is a queue? and their real world examples?
    A Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations
    are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO)
    Real-world Applications:
    1)Key press sequence in keyboard.
    2)used in networking printers. Printers hold their task in queue.
    3)Queue is also used by Operating systems for job scheduling.
    4)Used in BFS.

5)  How is B+ tree different from B Tree ?
    B-Tree:
      B-Tree is known as a self-balancing tree as its nodes are sorted in the inorder traversal.
    B+ -Tree:
      B+ tree eliminates the drawback B-tree used for indexing by storing data pointers only at 
      the leaf nodes of the tree. Thus, the structure of leaf nodes of a B+ tree is quite different from the structure of internal nodes of the B tree.
    Difference :

                            B- tree                   |                       B+ tree
                                                      |
     1) All internal and leaf nodes have pointers     |     1) Only leaf nodes have pointers.
                                                      |
     2) Searching is slower in B-tree                 |    2) Searching is Faster in B+ tree as all keys are at leaf nodes.
                                                      |
     3) Leaf Nodes are not Stored as structural       |    3) leaf nodes are stored as structural linked list.
        linked lists                                  |
     4) In a B -tree, search keys and data are stored |     4) But in B+ tree, data is stored only in leaf nodes.
        in internal or leaf nodes.                    |
 

6)   How do negative numbers are stored in memory ?
     Whenever a number with minus sign is encountered, the number is converted into its binary equivalent. The 2's 
     compliment is calculated and stored in a memory and sign bit is set to 1 .
     Whenever it comes on accesing that value first the sign bit is checked if it is 1 
     then the binary number will be 2 complemented and converted to decimal number.



     EXPERIENCE NUMBER - 2

1) Given a linked list and find its middle element.
       you can use fast and slow pointer. 

2) Implement merge sort but not in array,in linked list.
        ///refer to coding folder i had done it there.

3) Given a file consisting of billions of characters.Read the file and for each chunk of
   6 unique characters in the file map the string of all possible 6 letter chunks of 
   unique characters to a unique value. Print the entire output.

   EXPERIENCE NUMBER - 3
 
 1) TELL ME ABOUT YOUSELF?
     SIR, my name is vishav singh and i am currently persuing my b.tech in computer science from NIT Srinagar.
     and my current CGPA is 7.25.     
     I had a chance of gaining experience from one internship and a few academic and non- academic projects.
     
     I used to do competitive coding and i have reached  4* on codechef and a developer rank of 256 on hackerearth.
     
     In spare time,  i do competitive coding , read technical blogs and play badminton 
     
     I spent this past winter in Bangalore, working as an intern at IISC Bangalore. There i worked on computer vision project.
     It was a great experience overall and i learned a lot about computer vision and object detection and classification technologies.
     and i learnt a lot about time management as our schedule was very strict like 9 am to 7pm for  6 days a week.
     
     ///then interviewer will ask you about your project
     
     Sir, it was a research based project. we had to develop an algorithm which will avoid obstacles in front of our drone 
     with as much minimum computation as possible.
     So, after a lot of brainstorming, we thought of using ORB as object matching algorihm and used this to calculate distance and move our drone accordingly
     

 2) Write a program to check whether a string is a palindrome or not.
         use two pointer, reverse library funcion or stack or you can solve with any approacg you know.
    

 3) Write algorithm for heap sort.


















4)  Write a program to find the length of the linked list.
    do linear traversal of linked list and increment count everytime untill you reach last of the linked list

Python Questions be he wrote python in his resume ?

5) explain the concept of lambda function in python.
   its a small anonymous function. 
   In python, a lambda function is a single-line function declared with no name . it can have any number of arguments but it can only have 
   one expression.
   syntax 
          lambda arguments : expression
  eg. x  = lambda a:a+10;
      print(x(5))
      output : 15

6) what is self ?
   Self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class and is used to access variables that belongs to the class.

7) Difference b/w Python2 and Python3 ?
   In python3 , print statement is replaced with a print function.
   In python2 , implicit string type is ASCII but in python3 it is UNICODE.
   In python3 , range function is used in place of xrange.
   there is difference in error handling , As keyword is used in python3 whereas its not used in python2.
8) Tell me the difference between list & tuple ?
   
  i) Lists are mutable.
     Tuples are not.
  ii) lists consume more memory,
       tuples consume less memory as compared to the list.
  iii) lists have several built-in methods whereas tuples have no built-in methods
       like list have cmp(),len(),max(),min() methods.
   
9) What is regex?
   A regex is a short form for regular expression. and it is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern.
   Usually such string patterns are used by string-searching algorithms for find or find and replace operations.



INTERVIEW EXPERIENCE 4 

He asked some questions on my favorite language : java

1) is java an object-oriented language or object based language?
    
   Basic difference b/w object oriented and object based
 
             OBJECT - BASED
  i) object based supports use of objects and encapsulation.
  ii) They doesnot support inheritence or polymorphism or both.
  iii) Object based languages doesnot support built-in objects.
     eg. javascricpt etc.
                OBJECT ORIENTED 
  i) it supports all the features of OOPS including inheritence and polymorphism
  ii) They supports builtin objects.
    eg. java,c++


2) Difference b/w C and java?

  C is a low level, procedural language. whereas java is and object oriented , high level language.
  java uses objects whereas c used functions.
  c is faster as its closer to machine code where as java is easy to use and learn.


3) What is data abstraction. Explain with example.
   
   Abstraction means displaying only essential information and hiding the background details or implementation.
   
   Real life Example :
         consider a man driving a car , he only knows appling brakes stop the car and pressing accelerator will increase
         the speed . so he doesnt know about internal working of them . so it is abstraction.
   IN classes :
        public ,private access specifiers are used to implement abstraction.


4) How it is different from polymorphism ?
  Polymorphism is one thing having different forms.
  It includes function overloading , function overridding , operator overloading.


  Now interviewer shifted towards DBMS ?
 
1) what are primary keys ?
   It is  a field in a table which can uniquely identifies each row 

2) Write a query to find all data of employess with second-most salary.

   select * from employee where  salary < (select MAX(salary) from employee)
  
3) write a query to for sorting all entries of table by name.
   
   select * from table ORDER BY name


He asked to name some web technologies.
    html, css, javascript etc.

1) Explain me the difference b/w  html and html5
    
   Html does not support the audio or video tags whereas HTML5 does support.
   Html uses cookies to store temporary data , whereas html5 uses databases and application cache to store offline data.
   HTML doesnot allow javascript to run in browser, HTML5 supports javascript.
   HTML is less mobile-friendly, HTML5 is more mobile friendly.

2) what is c in css
   css stands for cascading style sheet.
3) Write a code for form validation.
   we can use automatic html form validation 
   
   <form action = " ---- " method="post">
     <input type ="text" name="fname" required>
     <input typ = "submit" value ="submit">
   </form>



And from data structure he asked a program to reverse a linked list.

  1) write a program to add fractions and output should also be in fraction
  
  2) write a sql query for count of male and female in a table. 
      if two queries :
         select count(gender) from table where gender ='male'
         select count(gender) from table where gender ='female'
      if only one query:
         select count(gender) from table group by gender
  3) write a sql query to find duplicate rows in a table
       suppose 2 columns name, age
