1) WHat are the advantages of DBMS over traditional file based   
   systems?
    
   i) Less data redundancy and less inconsistency.
   ii) Concurrent access by multiple users.
   iii) Atomicity of Updates.
   iv)  less integrity problems.

2) What are super, primary , candidate and foreign keys ?

  A super Key is a set of attributes of a relation upon which all attributes of the schema are functionally dependent.

 A candidate key is a minimal superkey.

 A primary key is one of the candidate keys  and it can uniquely identify rows in a table .

A foreign key is a field or column in one table that can uniquely identifies a row of another table.


3) Difference b/w primary key and unique constraints.
 
  Primary key cannot have null value whereas unique constraints can have.

  Primary key is only one in a table, there can be multiple unique constraints.


4) What is database normalization ?

   It is the process of analyzing a relation based on their functional dependencies and primary keys to achieve following properties.
1) Minimum redundancy .
2) Minimizing the insertion, deletion, and update Anomalies.


5) What is SQl ?

  It is a structured query language designed  for inserting and modyfing in a relational data base.

6) What is DDL, DML , DCL in sql
  
   DDL - Data definition language.
         SQL queries like create, drop, ALter , rename come under 
         this.
   DML  - Data manipulation language
         SQL queries like select, insert, update come under this.
   DCL  - Data control language 
         SQL queries like GRANT, revoke come under this.

7) what is the difference b/w having and where clause.

    The difference is where clause cannot be used with   
    aggregates, but having clause can be used
 
    Where clause works on row's data not on aggregated data.
    
8) What is a join ?
  
   An SQL join is used to combine data from two or more tables, 
   based on common field between them.

   i) INNER JOIN  - only intersection data 
   ii) left outer join  - intersection data along with left table
       data.
   iii) right outer join - intersection data along with right  
        table data. 
   iv) Full Outer join - return all records when there is match 
       in either left or right table.

9) What is identity ?
 
   Identity is a column that generates numeric values 
   automatically.
   
10) What is VIEW in SQL? How to create One.

  A view is a virtual table based on the result set of the sql 
  statement.
  
  create view view_name AS Select column_name from table_name  
  where condition 

11) What are the uses of view ?

   i) Views can represent a subset of data in a table. and can  
     limit exposure of data to the outer world.

   ii) views can join and simplify multiple tables into single    
   table.
   iii) views take very little storage . As database contains 
    only the definition of a view, not a copy of actutal data.
   
12) What is a Trigger ?
    A trigger is a code that is associaed with insert, update or delte operations . the code is executed automatically whenever the associated query is executed on the table. Triggers can be usefull to maintain integrity in database.

13) What are stored procedures ?
   A stored procedure is like a function that contains a set of operations compiled together. it contains set of operations that are commonly used in an applicationn to do some common database task.

14) What is the difference between Trigger and Stored Procedure?
  
   Unlike stored procedures, triggers cannot be called directly .   
   Triggers are associated with queries.

15) What is a transaction ? what are acide properties.

   A database transaction is a set of operations that must be treated as whole, either all operations are executed or none.
 ACID - Atomicity, consistency, isolation,durabilty.

Atomicity - it gurantees that each transaction can be treated as a single unit

Consitency - Transaction can only bring database from one consistent state to another.

Isolation - Each transaction will execute in isolation from other transactions.

Durabilty - it ensures that once a transaction is committed . it will remain committed even in case of system failure.


16) what re indexes ? 
    
    A database index is a data structures which improves the speed of data retrieval by use of more storage space to maintain extra copies of data.

17) What are clustered and non clustered indexes ?

   Clustered indexes is the index according to which data is physically stored on disk. Only one such indexing for a table.

   Non- clustered indexes - don't define physical ordering of data but logical ordering . eg. B tree, B+ tree are used for this purpose














******************************** SQL Queries ********************


1) Q. There is a table where only one row is fully repeated. Write a Query to find the Repeated row

Name	Section
abc	CS1
bcd	CS2
abc	CS1

Ans. Select name,section from table Group By name,section Having Count(*) > 1

2) Q. Query to find 2nd highest salary of an employee?

Select name,MAX(salary) As salry from employees where salary <(select Max(salary) from employees) 


3) Q. There is a table which contains two column Student and Marks, you need to find all the students, whose marks are greater than average marks i.e. list of above average students.


  select student,marks from table where marks > (select AVG(marks) from table)
