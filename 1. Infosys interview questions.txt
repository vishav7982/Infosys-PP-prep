1)  What is SDLC ?
    
    SDLC is software development life cycle and it is an end to end process that defines the flow 
    of development of a project from requirements stage to the maintainence stage and support stage.
    Stages in SDLC are: 
    Requirement analysis -> planning -> definition -> design -> development ->testing -> deployment and spport

2) What is waterfall model?
    just like waterfalls from top to bottom,
       this approach follows breaking down of project activities into different phases.
       Once a stage is completed, the next stage in the sequence is followed.
       Each stage is dependent on the result of the previous stage.



********************************* C and c++ questions ********************************

1) difference b/w c and c++ ?

  c is procedural language whereas c++ is object oriented language.
  In c dynamic memory allocation is done through malloc() and calloc() function, whereas in c++ new operator is used.
  No operator and function overloading in c, in c++ it exists under polymorphism
  exception handling is not supported in c, whereas it is supported in c++

2) What are the differences between C++ and Java? Which one do you think is better and why?
  
 c++ is a platform dependent language whereas java is platform independent
 c++ is used for system programming , and java is used for application programming
 c++ supports both pass by value and pass by reference , java doesnot support pass by reference
 c++ supports operator overloading , java doesnt
  

 I think c++ is better because of operator overloading and passing by reference.
 

3)What is OOPS concept and how is it implemented in C++?

OOPS (or object-oriented programming) is a programming methodology where an application program is designed 
considering everything as objects. It makes programming easy. 
The main oops concepts are â€“

Class â€“ contains methods and variables. You can use a class by creating objects of the class.

Inheritance â€“ when there are common properties that can be reused, we can create a parent class. 
    The child classes can then inherit the common methods and variables of the parent class.
     A very common example is the Animal class. 
     If Dog and Lion are two different animals, they can inherit the common methods of Animal like 
     run(), eat() or makeSound(). 
     The sound of Dog and Lion are different, so each will have their own implementation.

Polymorphism â€“ redefine the way the certain thing works using a different implementation. 
               Polymorphism can be achieved using overloading and overriding.

Abstraction â€“ for complex real-time programs, not all the details need to be shown to the
              user. Through abstraction, we can separate what an object does from how the 
              object works and show only â€˜whatâ€™ to the user.

Encapsulation â€“ encapsulation is based on the concept of having the data and code into a single unit to hide the
                internal workings of the code to an end-user. For example, a class encapsulates several member
                 variables and methods that may not be accessible outside the class.


4) What are Structs and how are they different from Classes?

   Struct is a customized data type that contains other data types. For example,
    Members of a class are private by default, to make a variable public, 
    we need to add the public modifier. 
    In a struct, by default members are public and if we need any private members,
    we have to use a modifier.
    A class can be inherited but structs cannot.
 

5) What is a pointer? Give an example.
    Pointer is a variable that stores the address of another variable. 
    Pointers allow passing variables by references using the address. For example â€“

    int a = 23;
    int *ptr = &a;
    cout << ptr;


5)  What is the difference between reference and pointer?
   
    Pointer stores the address of a variable, but the reference is just a copy 
    of a variable with a different name.
    int a;
    int *ptr = &a;
    // We use the & reference operator to initialize reference variable.
    int a = 20;
    int &ref = a;

6) What are virtual functions?

   A virtual function is a member function which is declared within a base class and 
   is re-defined(Overriden) by a derived class.
   Virtual functions ensure that the correct function is called for an object, regardless
   of the type of reference (or pointer) used for function call.
   It is used to achieve run time polymorphism
   
7) Give examples of data structures in C++.
   
    There are two types of data structures in C++ ? linear and nonlinear.
    Linear â€“ data elements are stored in sequence. Example, stack, queue and linked list.
    Non-linear â€“ tree and graph that are not stored in sequential manner.

8)  What is friend function/class?

    Friend function â€“ if a function is marked as a â€˜friendâ€™ of a particular class, 
                      it can access the protected and private members of the class.
     Friend class â€“ same as function, if a class is marked as friend of another class,
                    it can access the protected and private members of that class.

9) Why do we need the Friend class and function?
    
    Sometimes, there is a need for allowing a particular class to access private or protected members of a class. The solution is a friend class, 
    which is capable of accessing the protected as well as the private members of the class 
    in which it is declared as a friend.

    Similarly to the friend class, a friend function is able to access private and protected
    class members. A friend function can either be a global function or a method of some 
    class.

10) Is it possible for a C++ program to be compiled without the main() function?
    
    Yes, it is possible. However, as the main() function is essential for the execution of 
    the program,  the program will stop after compiling and will not execute.

11) What does a Static member in C++ mean?

   A static member is allocated storage, in the static storage area, only once during the program lifetime.

12) Post-increment â€˜itr++â€™ operator is more expensive than the pre-increment â€˜++itrâ€™ operator. why
   
   The post-increment operator generates a copy of the element before proceeding with
    incrementing the element and returning the copy. 
 
13)  What is a mutable storage class specifier?
    
  Sometimes there is requirement to modify one or more data members of class / struct
   through const function even though you donâ€™t want the function to update other members
   of class / struct. This task can be easily performed by using mutable keyword.


14) Define an Abstract class in C++?
   
    An abstract class in C++ is referred to as the base class, which has at least one pure virtual function.


*************** Java Interview Questions ***********************

1) How is polymorphism implemented in Java?
 
   Method overloading or static polymorphism
   That means a method with the same name can have different         
   number of parameters. Based on the parameter list, the  
   appropriate method will be called.
   print(String name){
        //code
    }
   print(int marks, String name){
      //code
    }
   print(String[] subjects, String name){
        //code
   }
   // in the main program,
   if(subjects.length >0){
        print(String[] subjects, String name);
   }
   else if(marks>0){ 
        print(int marks, String name);
   }
   else
       print(String name);

   Overriding or dynamic polymorphism
   
   his is the case when a child class extends parent class.    
   During run time when the object is created, the appropriate 
   method will be created.

2) What is the difference between stack and heap memory?
   
   Heap –

   JRE uses it to allocate memory for objects and JRE classes.
   Garbage collection is done on heap memory
   Objects created on heap are accessible globally.

   Stack –

    Short term references like the current thread of execution
    References to heap objects are stored in stack
    When a method is called, a new memory block is created. Once     
    the method gets executed, the block is used by the next   
    program.
    
   Stack memory size is smaller compared to heap memory.

3)  What is the difference between Array and ArrayList?

    The array has a fixed length, whereas the size of ArrayList 
    can grow dynamically as elements are added.
    ArrayList does not store primitives. If we have to store int 
    elements, each should be wrapped into Integer objects to be 
    stored in ArrayList. This is not the case with Array.



****************  SQL Interview Questions ****************

1) What is a database schema?

   Schema is a logical representation or structure of the entire  
   database. It defines how the data is organized, associated and 
   stored in the database.

2) What is RDBMS?
   
   Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) is a set of 
   programs that helps a developer to interact with the database 
   for creating, updating or deleting data. This is done through 
   queries (SQL).

3) What is the difference between unique key, foreign key and 
   primary key?
    
   Primary key – identifies each row in a table. For example, in 
   the student table, student_id can be the primary key used to 
   access the details of student. student_id will always be   
   different for different students. Can’t be null.


   Unique key – set of one or more fields that collectively 
   identify a database record. This should not include the  
   primary key. Unique key can have one null value. For example, 
   student_name and batch_number can be collectively used to   
   identify top students in last 3 years.

   Foreign key – a column that references the column of another   
   table to establish the relationship between two tables. Most 
   of the times, the primary key in one table is the foreign key 
   in another. For example, the book table can have student_id as 
   a foreign key that will determine the details of the books a 
   student has taken.

4) What are clustered indexes?

   Indexes are used to speed the query time to improve 
   performance. Think of it as an index in a book, which makes it 
   easy for you to navigate to a particular page or chapter. 
   Clustered index maintains the physical order of the data in a 
   table. For example, if a clustered index is created on the 
   student_id column of student table, student with student_id 5, 
   will be stored as the 5th row and with id 10 will be in the 
   10th row, irrespective of the order in which the data is 
   inserted.

5)What are SQL joins? How to use them to fetch data from multiple 
  tables?

   Joins are used to get results from multiple tables using primary and foreign keys of the related tables


6) What are SQL triggers?
 
   A trigger is a stored procedure in database which automatically invokes whenever a special event in the database occurs.

7)  what are views ?
Views in SQL are kind of virtual tables. A view also has rows and columns as they are in a real table in the database. We can create a view by selecting fields from one or more tables present in the database. A View can either have all the rows of a table or specific rows based on certain condition.
