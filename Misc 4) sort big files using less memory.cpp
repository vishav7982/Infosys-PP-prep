/*
   You can use external sorting algorithms that can handle
   massive amounts of data.
   External sorting is required when the data being sorted donot fit into
   the main memory of computing device.

   eg. External merge sort

        it is an external sorting algorithm in which it sorts chunks of size
        that fits in ram and then merges the sorted chunks together
